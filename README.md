# DataEngineering: NYC-Crime

NYC Crime Data Retrieval & Analysis System

Designed and implemented a full-scale ETL pipeline for NYC crime data, processing over 8.9 million records. Leveraged Apache Spark for data cleaning, validation, and transformation. Utilized MongoDB to store raw backups and PostgreSQL for structured, analytics-ready data. Developed an interactive dashboard using Flask and HTML to visualize historical crime trends with dynamic filtering. Additionally, explored Neo4j to model complex relationships such as suspect–crime–location linkages for advanced graph-based analysis.
